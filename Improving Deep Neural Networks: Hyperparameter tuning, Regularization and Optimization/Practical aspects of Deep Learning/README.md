This is lab assignments complted as a part of Coursera Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng.

# 1. Initialization


# 2. Regularization 

In this program you will:

- Understand that different regularization methods that could help your model.

- Implement dropout and see it work on data.

- Recognize that a model without regularization gives you a better accuracy on the training set but nor necessarily on the test set.

- Understand that you could use both dropout and regularization on your model.

# 3. Gradient checking

This program implemnts gradient checking to make sure that your backpropagation implementation is correct. In this program you will:

- Implement gradient checking from scratch.

- Understand how to use the difference formula to check your backpropagation implementation.

- Recognize that your backpropagation algorithm should give you similar results as the ones you got by computing the difference formula.

- Learn how to identify which parameter's gradient was computed incorrectly.
