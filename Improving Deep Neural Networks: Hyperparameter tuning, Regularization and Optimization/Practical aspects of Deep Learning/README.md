This is lab assignments complted as a part of Coursera Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng.

# 1. Initialization

# 2. Regularization 

In this program you will:

- Understand that different regularization methods that could help your model.

- Implement dropout and see it work on data.

- Recognize that a model without regularization gives you a better accuracy on the training set but nor necessarily on the test set.

- Understand that you could use both dropout and regularization on your model.
